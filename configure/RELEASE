# directory whenever this file is changed or any external module
# pointed to by this RELEASE file is rebuilt.

# If you don't want to install files into $(TOP) then define
# INSTALL_LOCATION_APP here:

# Define path to sequencer if needed
#SNCSEQ=/epics/seq

# Asyn - modify to point to youe ASYN location
ASYN=/epics/asyn

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can preempt definitions
# Modify to point to your EPICS base location
#
EPICS_BASE=/epics/base
